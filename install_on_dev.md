# Web App Manifest 

* The web manifesto provides metadate to instruct the browser about how the PWA should be rendered and displayed on a users device. *

> Basically information about the web app that is stored in a JSON file that makes the app downloadable 

Typically the manifest file is stored at the root of the app named: __manifest.json__ or __anythingYOUWant.webmanifest__

To associate said manifest to the app it has to be added to a link tag in the head section of an HTML doc.
